/* 1. Abstracts — 
 *    The abstract folder is something different from
 *    other folders. Styles written in this folder do 
 *    not compile to CSS. They are the helpers for 
 *    other folders. Two major SASS Abstracts are 
 *    variables and mixins.
 *    - this subdirectory contains no actual styles, 
 *    but rather just functions and mechanisms that 
 *    help to define other styles (essentially your 
 *    “helpers” directory).
